# Work-Day-Scheduler


## Description 

This project is a CWRU Coding Bootcamp homework assignment. This goal of this assignment is to create a simple planner application where a user can fill out tasks by the hour and save that input to local storage. Basic HTML and CSS was provided, and the student was to write the JavaScript.<br>

The purpose of this homework assignment is to continue to practice jQuery, along with using local storage in the web browser.<br>

The acceptance criteria given in the assignment is as follows:<br>

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule<br>
WHEN I open the planner<br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar<br>
<br>
WHEN I scroll down<br>
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours<br>
<br>
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day<br>
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future<br>
<br>
WHEN I click into a time block<br>
THEN I can enter an event<br>
<br>
WHEN I click the save button for that time block<br>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage<br>
<br>
WHEN I refresh the page<br>
THEN the saved events persist<br>
<br>
